# LinkedList

## Summary

The included files defines functions that form an ordered linked list. All of 
the nodes are inserted into the list in order.

## Complexity

Using big O notation for time complexity we find insertion complexity is O(n),
delete is O(n), and find is O(n). Overall not the best data structure to use for time 
reasons. 

Looking at auxiliary space complexity we find that each operation is O(1). This 
is because each operation only requires making one Node, which isn't proportional
to how many elements there are. 

## How to Use

If you want to use this linked list you need to make sure that the data type 
you are storing is correct. It has been written for doubles, and would need 
to be adapted to your data type.
